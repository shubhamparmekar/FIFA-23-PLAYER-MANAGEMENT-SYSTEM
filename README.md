## About FMS

FIFA 23 Player management system is a player management software for monitoring and accessing players based on their FIFA 23 PC/XBOX game ratings. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for front-end development, and PHP and MySQL were used for back-end development. The system mainly focuses on basic operation like adding a new player, new statistics, searching players with detailed information and edit as they grow their skills. It is a web-based application designed and developed to help users access players and organize their teams. It’s easy to use, and it features a familiar and attractive user interface combined with strong searching, insertion, and deletion with procedure capabilities.

## FMS requirements

One of the most difficult tasks is the selection of correct version of software. Once the system requirements are known the next step is to determine whether the software package fits the requirements. After initial selection further security is needed to determine the desirability of software compared with other candidates. This section first summarizes the application requirement question and then suggests more detailed comparisons.

## Description of FMS

This project consists of player details which include the likes of player’s age and nationality. It also consists of player statistics which include players technical skills. It also consists of tables containing information such as player earnings, club, and preferred position to play. It also provides a strong search, update, delete, and insert operations delivered with a user-friendly web-based UI. The project also helps the users to keep track of the player details in a computerized way without any trouble. The project contains 7 stored procedures and 3 triggers per table. Stored procedures are used in search engine. Every time the user searches through the database, a procedure is called, and the results is collected and displayed for the user in a structured manner. It also has 3 triggers namely “Insert, Delete and Update” triggers assigned separately to each table. Whenever operations such as insert or delete or update is performed on any table, these triggers are automatically called, and the logs are captured into 3 separate tables, individually for each trigger. Hence use of triggers provides users to trace back all the latest as well as the oldest changes into any table at any point of time.
